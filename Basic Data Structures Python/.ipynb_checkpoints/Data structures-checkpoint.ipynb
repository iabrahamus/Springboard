    "This ability to change the physical implementation of an abstract data type while maintaining the logical characteristics is an example of abstraction at work. However, even though the stack will work either way, if we consider the performance of the two implementations, there is definitely a difference. Recall that the <font color='red'>append</font> and `pop()` operations were both `O(1)`. This means that the first implementation will perform `push` and `pop` in constant time no matter how many items are on the stack. The performance of the second implementation suffers in that the `insert(0)` and `pop(0)` operations will both require `O(n)` for a stack of size n. Clearly, even though the implementations are logically equivalent, they would have very different timings when performing benchmark testing."

Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the problem.\n",

At a certain point in the game, the action is stopped and the child who has the item (the potato) is removed from the circle. Play continues until only one child is left.\n",

She will then wait until all the others have been at the front before it will be her turn again. After num dequeue/enqueue operations, the child at the front will be removed permanently and another cycle will begin.

These students typically print up to twice during that time, and the length of these tasks ranges from 1 to 20 pages. The printer in the lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute of draft quality. The printer could be switched to give better quality, but then it would produce only five pages per minute. The slower printing speed could make students wait too long. What page rate should be used?\n",

    "We could decide by building a simulation that models the laboratory. We will need to construct representations for students, printing tasks, and the printer (Figure 4). As students submit printing tasks, we will add them to a waiting list, a queue of print tasks attached to the printer. When the printer completes a task, it will look at the queue to see if there are any remaining tasks to process. Of interest for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their papers to be printed. This is equal to the average amount of time a task waits in the queue.\n",

This means that there is equal chance of any length from 1 to 20 appearing.\n",

    "A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue. It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection. What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items. New items can be added at either the front or the rear. Likewise, existing items can be removed from either end. In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure. Figure 1 shows a deque of Python data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that even though the deque can assume many of the characteristics of stacks and queues, it does not require the LIFO and FIFO orderings that are enforced by those data structures. It is up to you to make consistent use of the addition and removal operations.\n",
